Summer Fruits with Ice Wine Sabayon

INGREDIENTS

6 egg yolks

6 Tbsp sugar

3 Tbsp lemon juice

3 Tbsp Icewine or other sweet dessert wine

2 Tbsp whipping cream

6 cup fresh seasonal fruits (sliced peaches, berries, apricots, etc)

DIRECTIONS

1. Whisk egg yolks, sugar, lemon juice and Icewine in a metal or glass bowl until combined. Place bowl over a pot of gently simmering water (so that bowl does not touch) and whisk constantly until mixture doubles in volume and holds a “ribbon” when whisk is lifted. Remove from heat and stir in cream. Chill until ready to serve.

2. To serve, arrange fresh fruits in parfait glasses or fruit cups. Spoon sabayon over and serve.

3. Sabayon can be made up to a day in advance.
